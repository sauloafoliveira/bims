Bi-directional Importance Map Similarity for image retargting quality assessment.

## Getting Started
 
The Matlab Code (Version 1.0) is created by Saulo Oliveira, 
Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil
which is based on the method described in the following paper

> A Bi-directional Evaluation-based Approach for Image Retargeting Quality Assessment
> Computer Vision and Image Understaning

There is also a folder named ** cuhk_dataset ** in which the  features (alpha_1, alpha_2, beta, and rho) and label (MOS)  and support scripts are located.


## Running 

The code has been tested on the MacOS 64-bit.
> To run the code: simple run main.m

## Acknowledgement 
The Matlab codes are for non-comercial use only.
